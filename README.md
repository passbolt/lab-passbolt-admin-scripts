# Useful Scripts
This repository is meant to hold various scripts that passbolt users might find useful.

## backup.sh
This script takes a database dump, copies the server GPG keys, and then `tar`s them in a designated location so that it is easier to implement a good backup plan. This backup script requires the ability to run mysqldump or mariadb-dump if you are running MariaDB > 10.4.6, on the host you are running it on. This means that for Docker installs you'll need to install mariadb-server. Additionally the user you run this as will need the correct permissions to access the `/etc/passbolt` directory and wherever you select as the backup directory(currently set to `/tmp`).
